# Contribution Guidelines

## Creating issues

Feature requests and bug reports should be made by using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cachethq/Cachet/issues). Support questions should be directed to our support email; [support@alt-three.com](mailto:support@alt-three.com?subject=Cachet Support).

**Always be respectful.** Organization members reserve the right to lock topics if they feel necessary.

## Languages

Any non-English translations must be made on the [Cachet CrowdIn](https://translate.cachethq.io) project. This makes syncing translations much easier.

## Coding Standards

Please follow existing coding standards. Pull Requests are checked and can be fixed by [StyleCI](https://styleci.io).

## Introduction into Git and GitHub

If you are new to Git, GitHub and the whole open source software community, welcome! Here are some resources for getting started and understanding what it's all about.

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) by Code School
- [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com)

If you're not particularly fond of the command line, you can get one of GitHub's free GUI desktop apps:

- [GitHub for Mac](https://github.com/blog/1510-installing-git-from-github-for-mac)
- [GitHub for Windows](https://github.com/blog/1127-github-for-windows)

If you're feeling adventurous, you can become a Git & GitHub master with the [Git Path on Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/git).

## .editorconfig

You should also make use of the [.editorconfig](/.editorconfig) file found within the root of the repository. It'll make sure that your editor is setup with the same file settings.
